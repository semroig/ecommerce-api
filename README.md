## How to run locally

This project works with a Python virtual environment. For that sake, the first time you'll need to create that environment locally, activate it and install all the dependencies:

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The next times, you'll just need to activate it ðŸ˜‰ and run the app:

```
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

When you are done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment with just running:

```
deactivate
```

## Setting up PostgreSQL instance url variable

In order for the app to work, you need to set up the PostgreSQL instance url variable. It is an environment variable that **sqlalchemy** uses to connect and run the engine. Go to *env/bin/activate* and add this line to the file (setting *your_database_url* with the correct url):

```
export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL='your_database_url'
```
