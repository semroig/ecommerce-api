# Ecommerce-api

A generic API for an ecommerce backend service. Developed with Python FastAPI and PostgreSQL.

## How to run locally

This project works with a Python virtual environment. For that sake, the first time you'll need to create that environment locally, activate it and install all the dependencies:

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The next times, you'll just need to activate it ðŸ˜‰ and run it:

```
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

When you are done working with the app, you can deactivate the virtual environment with just running:

```
deactivate
```
